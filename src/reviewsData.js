        presentation:{
            "Graphical Detail":"Keep in mind that I played this game through backwards compatibility on the Xbox Series X so the resolution was boosted when I played. I'm sure it would have looked sharp on a CRT back in its heyday, especially if it was played on a CRT with progressive scan as the game supports 480p. The resolution is bolstered with very detailed environments that feel like actual real world locations rather than video game mission environments, but what really steals the show is the game's lighting system adding to the visuals. The lighting very accurately and dynamically casts shadows from the objects it's pointed to and is used as a gameplay mechanic like showing an enemies location or creating shadows to sneak through, creating some really tense moments. Some lighting effects are obviously static, for example a very common lighting effect seen in the game where you can see tiny light shafts through window blinds or another small gap where light can pass but it's expertly placed in locations that make sense and although static do look very nice, overall continuing to support a atmosphere that makes the player feel like an ‘american ninja’ in a highly detailed environment.",
        },
        story:{
            "Story":"The game's story revolves around the discovery that the Georgian President is trying to declare war against the United States, and Third Echelon is doing whatever it takes to prevent it from happening. As you complete missions you'll collect information from computers and data sticks that are found on downed enemies that'll detail the tactics of the enemy president. You can read all the collected data but a lot of the time your team will summarize the important story information, and the way it delivers the story really immerses you into the shoes of a secret agent with alot of political and military jargon that’s reminiscent of metal gear solid. Then in between missions cutscenes will play showing various news channels displaying information on the data collected in each mission, and sometimes new information that will give context to the next missions goals and restrictions which gives the game a more realistic feel regardless of the fact you’re just completing missions. What I found to be really enjoyable is the actions that the Georgian president takes to harm the infrastructure of the U.S because of how plausible it is to reality . In terms of gameplay the story does a great job in giving context to why you'll have certain restrictions in a mission, like not being able to be spotted or only nonlethal, because a lot of the time Third Echelon has to gather information in places that killing or being spotted would be either illegal or can jumpstart World War 3. I think the strongest part of this story is the fact everything feels like it can happen, and as a game that is based on Tom Clancy novels, making the game's plot feel so plausible shows that the developers at ubisoft did a great job staying faithful to Tom Clancy’s writing",
        },
        gameplay:{
            "Sam's Moveset":"Many of the missions in Splinter Cell are filled with multiple enemies, and also lights that can't be destroyed. Fortunately accompanied with your assault rifle, are gadgets that give the player some more wiggle room when trying to decide how they are going to sneak by enemy soldiers, granted you'll have to play half the game before you get them. Before the gadgets you only had to use timing, lighting, and quiet movements to avoid detection, but with gadgets like the sticky cameras, diversion cameras, and the rifle for more accurate light shooting, the game starts feeling like a very tense puzzle.  Sometimes you can even find vents to crawl into and completely avoid enemies entirely or pipes that you can use to basically crawl across the ceiling. Sam also has a couple of acrobatic moves that he can pull off to get to higher places or run up a wall if a pathway is narrow enough and hold himself to avoid or fall on enemies. The game constantly makes the player examine the environment and find the best route to take without getting caught, and when this is happening successfully the game can feel extremely rewarding and satisfying.",
            "Hyperaware Enemies":"As you'd expect from a stealth game, sneaking is the main gameplay mechanic and in this game it's great…when it feels fair. Unfortunately, in this game enemies are hyper aware causing a lot of frustration. Being slightly in light causes enemies to investigate or even spot you, falling from high or even short falls makes them investigate. Even the acrobatic moves like the wall hop makes the enemies investigate, breaking all desire to do the sam's acrobatic moves. Sometimes enemies don't even leave rooms that they are investigating, so if you're stuck and waiting for them to leave you might be forced to reload and potentially redo a whole section. The enemies also walk pretty fast normally and when investigating, so when you're trying to sneak up behind them to knock them out it's best to wait until they stop because if you move too quickly behind them they'll hear you. Then there is also a chance that they'll start turning while you're trying to catch up and since it takes two hits to knock out the guard, any nearby guards will be alerted even if the guard that spotted you never shot his gun. All these issues would naturally make you come to the conclusion to avoid enemies at all cost but since the missions are very linear you don't have many options to avoid enemies, so the gameplay boils down to trial and error taking away the feeling of control and taking you right out of sam fisher's shoes. Then depending on how recently the game allowed you to save, you could end up having to replay a chunk of a level multiple times when you die. It's really a shame because when everything is going well and you're sneaking past guards and using your gadgets, the game flows so well.",
            "Level Design":"A majority of the mission runtime is designed around stealth but there are certain flaws in the game that bring down the level design and the game. You'll spend a lot of your time in these missions in office buildings that don't give you much leeway in avoiding detection, so when paired with the hyperaware enemies you'll find yourself back in trial and error gameplay. There will even be moments where enemies will turn on lights or appear out of nowhere resulting in a gunfight unless you memorized the levels. If you find yourself in a gunfight you'll realize the game wasn't designed for it, resulting in sluggish gameplay and many deaths. What makes it worse is the game forces you into gunfights in certain missions and for me it personally caused a lot of my deaths."
        },
        conclusion:"This game has its problems when it comes to its AI that creates problems in the gameplay of this game. The environments are actually very detailed but can be really samey with similar and linear locations, but the game is still without a doubt above average with its amazing stealth when it's working. I really don't know how this game got near perfect scores in the past, but I'm happy it did because later entries in the series definitely refined this game's mechanics. Overall it's still a solid game but you need to be aware that you're gonna be facing a really dated save system and enemies that have the heightened senses of a hawk.",
